export const aboutMarkdown = `# Intro

I'm Abdullah — a statistician, AI researcher, and entrepreneur. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Mathematical Statistics while managing two companies: an AI think tank focused on generative modeling (including synthetic financial data) and a logistics/distribution startup in the pet food industry. My work spans quant finance, AI systems, R&D in time-series modeling, and business development in emerging markets.

I’m passionate about making advanced tools accessible — from synthetic data pipelines for financial risk modeling to operational innovations for e-commerce supply chains. My goal is to blend academic rigor with real-world impact.

# Some History

- I was born on October 16, 1999, and grew up in South Africa.
- I have three degrees: two in actuarial science and one in artificial intelligence.
- At 21, I began working in quantitative finance and eventually joined Deloitte as a quant analyst.
- At 23, I started my own AI company focusing on GANs, Normalizing Flows, and synthetic data generation — applying this research to real-world use cases in banking and risk modeling.
- Around the same time, I co-founded a halal pet food company distributing premium products across the UAE and soon Saudi Arabia.
- I’ve published work on volatility modeling, Bayesian deep learning, and synthetic FX/equity market simulation.
- I’ve been balancing three roles — quant, CEO, and master's student — and documenting this journey as "The Journey of a Young CEO."

# I Like

- Making complex ideas understandable
- Synthetic data & generative models
- Research in econometrics and machine learning
- Entrepreneurship and building systems from scratch
- Apex Legends and Rust (when I can find time to play)
- Content creation and animation for educational channels
- Analyzing geopolitical trends and their impact on global markets

# Travel / Geography

- I live in South Africa, but plan to relocate to Europe within a year — most likely the Netherlands or the UK.
- I’ve worked with partners in Malaysia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia.
- I’m deeply interested in cross-border logistics, trade, and import/export dynamics in the Middle East.

# Fun Facts

- I run a YouTube channel called **The Journey of a Young CEO** and stream under **Alex The Good Enough**, focused on strategy and gaming.
- I’ve built GARCH + Normalizing Flow hybrid models from scratch.
- I’ve optimized image tiling for geospatial AI tasks and trained GANs on FX and equity data.
- I love organizing chaos — in codebases, business operations, and project planning.
- I’ve learned to prioritize progress over perfection (still a work in progress).

# I Dream Of

- Bridging the gap between frontier AI research and business applications.
- Helping young founders scale ideas without burning out.
- Building AI tools that help emerging economies make smarter decisions.
- One day teaching or mentoring — formally or informally.
